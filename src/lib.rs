//! # GGRS
//! GGRS (good game rollback system) is a reimagination of the GGPO network SDK written in 100% safe Rust ðŸ¦€.
//! The callback-style API from the original library has been replaced with a much saner, simpler control flow.
//! Instead of registering callback functions, GGRS returns a list of requests for the user to fulfill.
